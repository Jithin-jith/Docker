A Docker volume is a directory stored in the host filesystem (or managed by Docker) that is mounted into one or more containers.

Why Use Docker Volumes?

1.Data Persistence
    Volumes ensure that data remains intact even if the container is stopped, restarted, or deleted.
2.Sharing Data Between Containers
    Multiple containers can mount the same volume and access shared data.
3.Backup and Restore
    Volumes can easily be backed up or migrated by copying the volume directory on the host.
4.Separation of Concerns
    Keeps your data separate from the container image, improving modularity and security.

Steps to create and check a docker Volumes

1. create a ubuntu container in interactive mode with volume option
docker run -it -v <system_path/data:\container_path\test\data\> ubuntu

2. Create a file in the system_path\data
cd system_path/test/data/
mkdir Docker/test/data/testing_docker_volumes.txt

3. This file will be created in the docker file location as well (\container_path\test\data\)

4. Stop docker container
(usually when a docker container is stopped all the data will be erased, but now since we have mounted that onto host the data will persist.)

5.start docker container
docker start <CONTAINER_ID>

6.execute the docker container
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash

7. Navigate to the directory and check
cd data/test
